# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your values

# ===== API Configuration =====
# Backend API Base URL
# Development: Leave empty for auto-detection (will use http://localhost:3001)
# Production: Set to your API domain (e.g., https://api.yourdomain.com)
# If running on same domain with reverse proxy: Leave empty for relative paths
VITE_API_URL=

# ===== Media Upload Configuration =====
# Maximum file size for image uploads (in MB)
# Must match or be less than backend MEDIA_MAX_IMAGE_MB
# Default: 5MB
VITE_MEDIA_MAX_IMAGE_MB=5

# Maximum file size for audio uploads (in MB)
# Must match or be less than backend MEDIA_MAX_AUDIO_MB
# Default: 15MB
VITE_MEDIA_MAX_AUDIO_MB=15

# Allowed image file formats (comma-separated MIME types)
# Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF
# Default: image/jpeg,image/png
VITE_MEDIA_ALLOWED_IMAGE_TYPES=image/jpeg,image/png

# Allowed audio file formats (comma-separated MIME types)
# Supported formats: MP3, WAV, OGG
# Default: audio/mpeg,audio/mp3
# Note: audio/mp3 is non-standard but some browsers use it for MP3 files
VITE_MEDIA_ALLOWED_AUDIO_TYPES=audio/mpeg,audio/mp3

# ===== Development Notes =====
# - Frontend auto-detects localhost and uses port 3001 for API
# - In production, use reverse proxy or set VITE_API_URL explicitly
# - Media size limits are validated on both frontend and backend
# - Backend limits are the final authority (see next-api/.env.example)
